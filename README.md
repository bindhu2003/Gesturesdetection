Real Time Pose Analysis is a project combines computer vision techniques of both cricket signals and yoga poses using a webcam feed. By using PoseDetector module, the system detects human poses. It extracts landmark points of a human to analyze angles between them. This project detects yoga poses such as "Pranaam Asana", "Hastha Uttasana", "Hasthapadasana", "Ashwa Sanchalan Asana", "Dandasana" and "Parvatasana". This project detects cricket signals including "OUT", "6", "4" , "WIDE" and "TIME_OUT" based on predefined angle criteria. The detected yoga pose or cricket signal will be displayed on the screen.
